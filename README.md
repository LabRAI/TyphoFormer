# 🏆[SIGSPATIAL 25 Best Short Paper Award] TyphoFormer
Language-Augmented Transformer for Accurate Typhoon (Hurricane) Track Forecasting

## 🧭 1.Project Overview
> TyphoFormer is a hybrid multi-modal Transformer designed for tropical cyclone (other names: Hurricane, Typhoon) track prediction. It integrates `numerical meteorological features` and `LLM-augmented language embeddings` through a Prompt-aware Gating Fusion (PGF) module, followed by a spatio-temporal Transformer backbone and autoregressive decoding for track forecasting.
